## Overview

The challenge will be based on interacting with an email bot.

## Overall Flow

1. Recieve email from email bot.
2. Email bot gives easy first puzzle which leads to discord bot.
3. Discord bot must be "defeated" before you can speak to the email bot again
4. Email bot has a secret master: _snail mail bot_

## Delivery / Starting Point

1. Email bot will send link to discord server.
2. Follow-up messages to email bot without unlock clue will send messages
   redirecting towards discord bot until discord bot has been defeated.

## Challenges

### Initial

- WAV file playing avenger's theme, which breaks down and becomes wacky at the
  end because the end of the file is just the binary representation of the link
  to the discord bot repeated over and over again.

### Discord Bot

### Email Bot

### Snail Mail Bot: **The Pony Express**

Mail bot can be thought of as the "final boss." For these puzzles, Nick
will have to wait days to find out if his clue was correct. If the messages
are long and/or encrypted, he will have to type them accurately before
he can work with them programmatically.
