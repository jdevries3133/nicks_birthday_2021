# Plan for Email-Execution-Engine Puzzles

**Devices to Use**

- Metaprogramming
  - Operator overloading on native types
    - `1 + 1 = "the answer to the puzzle!"`
    - endless possibilities
- `console.log`
  - Take away python print
  - Make him do `console.log`
  - Put the feat of javascript in his eyes
- Add hints into the runtime to make it easier
- Add additional puzzles into the runtime to progressively disclose
  complexity.
- End the puzzle with something he will hopefully do many times in order
  to get many letters sent.
