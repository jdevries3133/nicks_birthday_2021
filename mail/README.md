## Transition to Snail Mail Puzzles

After the final email puzzle, the following prompt will be sent via email:

> You kids and your newfangled technology think you have it all figured out!
> Feel free to keep being a techie with these fancy shmancy _"emails!"_ You
> can email me all you want – and I will get back to you – but I'll be
> switching to a more dignified means of communication; thank you very much!

After this email is sent, the emailer will act in a read-only mode. It will
continue to watch for and respond to emails from Nick, but only respond via
mail.

## Puzzle Design

Snail mail puzzles will be progressively more difficult riddles. The prompts
will be sent via mail, for all intents and purposes, there will be only
one acceptable answer. However, for the sake of making the puzzles more
intuitive, a set of strings may be accepted as the actual answer. For example:

| Correct Answer | Set of Acceptable Strings                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| a snow storm   | snow storm, blizzard, snowfall, snow day |
